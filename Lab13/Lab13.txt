Q1: M_1 is encrypted using the key E_K.

E_K is made using PR(A)(PU(B)).

M_1 is then encrypted when it equals E_K(M_1).

Q2: M_3 is decrypted using the key D_K.

D_K is made using PR(B)(PU(A)).

The message M_3 is then encrypted such that it equals D_K(M_3).

Q3: Alice can encrypt the message to Bob using the formula E = (M_2^e % N ) using her private key and bob's public key to obtain the values

Q3(cont.): Bob can decipher the message using his private key and Alice's public key.
If the message is from Alice, it can be deciphered into a text message easily, if not it's not from her.
